Planet Or Die - Ludum Dare 38


Noah

Good
- Ticket system helped with organization a TON
- We managed to get tons of stuff done. Good focus from the whole team.
- Role assignments were a great fit for the team members

Bad
- Too much stuff last second
- Should have playtested a bit more near the end

Improvement Ideas
- Small set of clear rules (anyone can change anything, but if it comes up, the role owner decides)


Silas

Good
- We nailed all of our 3 project goals
- Team communication, organization and focus were excellent

Bad
- Later content was very rushed and unpolished

Improvement Ideas
- Be prepared for deployment strategies in advance


Tim

Good
- Project development had a great flow
- No major hiccups

Bad
- Untested hard-coded strings are very error-prone
- Last-second content is not as high-quality

Improvements Ideas
- We should clearly communicate that people who make controversial decisions are responsible for the results those of decisions
